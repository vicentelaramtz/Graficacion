/**
 * The Julia Fractal family is my personal favorite.  This class is to show and
 * explain the math behind it.  It can be very complicated, so I will try to
 * explain it as best as I can.  This is NOT meant to be a comrehensive guide
 * to Fractals, or the Julia Set.  This is only to help you understand how it 
 * works.  This is a VERY simple example, and is for educational purposes only.
 * Please do not claim this as your own, or submit it as your own work.
 * 
 * Please excuse any spelling errors you may find.  I'm a programmer, not a speller.
 * 
 * Complex Numbers are the key to fractals.  A complex number is in the form:
 * a+bi, where a & b are real numbers, and i = sqrt(-1).
 * 
 * Generating fractals involves doing math in the Complex Plane.  You can think 
 * of the Complex Plane in the following way:
 * i-values
 * |
 * |* (1+6i)
 * |
 * |  * (2+4i)
 * |
 * |      *(x+yi)
 * |_ _ _ _ _ _ real values.
 * 
 * The i-values (imaginary values) go up & down the "y" axis, and the real numbers
 * go out along the "x" axis.  (Note that I only drew the one quadrant, all four
 * are used).
 * 
 * The Julia Set is created by putting each point through an algorithm, and adding
 * it to the set by determining how close it is to infinity.  If the threshold^2
 * is less than the Magnitude of the Complex Number (where magnitude = a^2 + b^2),
 * the point is added to the set.  The iteration value determins how many times the 
 * point is put through the algorithm.  Putting it through more times, and making 
 * the threshold much smaller, leads to cleaner images, but they take longer to create.
 * 
 * The values in this example give a good depiction of a Julia Set.
